    "description": "The sketch outlines an AI-driven system for assessing user proficiency in various topics. It includes a baseline proficiency test, a session interaction with an AI assistant, evaluation by an evaluator, and a summarization of the session. The process is documented and archived for future reference.",
    "differences": "The sketch represents a structured and automated proficiency assessment system. Unlike traditional methods that require human intervention at multiple stages, this system leverages AI for session management and preliminary evaluation. Real-world applications may not achieve the same level of automation and standardization, often relying on human oversight and interpretation in assessing proficiency.",
    "insights": [
        "Automation streamlines the evaluation process, potentially reducing bias.",
        "Baseline tests calibrate the starting proficiency level, personalizing user interactions.",
        "The system can maintain an extensive archive, useful for tracking progress over time.",
        "Evaluator summaries provide additional layers of validation and feedback.",
        "Visual indicators (height, color) for proficiency offer an immediate understanding of results."
