    "description": "This sketch is a hand-drawn representation of the process for forming and validating opinions and arguments. It utilizes references to Wikipedia data, unpopular opinions, and advanced knowledge to structure an approach to argument construction and evidence gathering. It includes flowcharts depicting how opinions are influenced and the depth of knowledge required for substantiated arguments.",
    "differences": "Today's reality often relies more heavily on digital tools, social media, and instantaneous information dissemination compared to the more methodical, step-by-step framework visualized here. The sketch suggests a deliberate process of validation and knowledge gathering, contrasting with the rapid and sometimes superficial consumption of information prevalent today.",
    "insights": [
        "The process emphasizes the importance of examining words and context before forming opinions.",
        "There's a notable focus on using Wikipedia and Reddit as sources for preliminary data and opinions respectively.",
        "The transition from common knowledge to advanced knowledge is shown as requiring rigorous questioning and evidence collection.",
        "Highlighting loaded words and emotions suggests the presence of bias in arguments.",
        "The visual of 'infinite canvas' implies never-ending research and continuous opinion evolution."
