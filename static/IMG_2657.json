    "description": "The sketch represents a conceptual plan for a smart plant monitoring system. It illustrates a setup where plants are monitored for various parameters such as light, environment settings, and humidity. A section simulates a brain for decision-making processes, and there's a checklist for plant maintenance. The design includes taking photos, analyzing plants, and creating 3D models.",
    "differences": "In today's reality, such plant monitoring systems are typically more technology-driven and integrated with real-time IoT devices and cloud-based systems. The sketch presents a more simplistic and manual setup as compared to the automated solutions available today.",
    "insights": [
        "Use of augmented reality (AR) to place 3D models of plants in a space.",
        "Incorporates a brain-like decision-making unit, hinting towards AI integration.",
